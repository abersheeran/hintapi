This is an asynchronous web framework, designed to quickly build the required web services, whether it is Templates or APIs. So far, typedweb has no built-in database, cache and other functions. For those with difficulty in choosing, please use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) directly.

If you find any bugs, please visit [Github Issues](https://github.com/abersheeran/typedweb/issues) for feedback; if you have something to share, discuss with others, or want to add Features, welcome to visit [Github Discussions](https://github.com/abersheeran/typedweb/discussions) to initiate a discussion.

## Design inspiration

The name comes from kennethreitz's [project of the same name](https://github.com/kennethreitz-archive/typedweb), but with the development of various ideas...it gradually deviates from the original design.
